        <h1>Simple Patterns, Confusing Names</h1>
        <p>Let’s be honest: tech jargon can be a nightmare.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, I came across the term <strong>“early exit pattern.”</strong> It sounded fancy, so I read about
            it, nodded, and moved on. Then it dawned on me: I’d been using this pattern for years without knowing it had
            a name.</p>
        <p>The <strong>early exit pattern</strong> is just a way to check for problems or special cases at the start of
            a function and leave early, instead of wrapping everything in a big <code>if</code> block. Like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">function processUser(user) {
  if (!user) {
    return; // Exit early if user is missing
  }

  // Continue with normal processing
  console.log(`Processing user: ${user.name}`);
}
</code></pre>
        <p>If someone had asked me in an interview, “Do you use the early exit pattern?” I’d probably blink twice,
            mumble something about return statements, and hope the conversation moved on.</p>
        <p>This happens a lot. People do good work but feel unsure because they don’t know the official name for what
            they do. It’s like showing up to a club where everyone knows the secret handshake, but you don’t even know
            there’s a handshake.</p>
        <p>Another common confusion is around words like <strong>model</strong>, <strong>entity</strong>, and
            <strong>domain object.</strong> These terms get tossed around like hot potatoes. For a non-native English
            speaker, it’s even harder to keep track. What one person calls a “model” might just be a plain data object
            to someone else.</p>
        <p>Let’s look at another example: <strong>memoization.</strong> It sounds complicated, but it’s really just
            remembering the result of a function call so you don’t do the same work twice.</p>
        <p>Here’s how it looks in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = new Map();
  return function (arg) {
    if (cache.has(arg)) {
      return cache.get(arg);
    }
    const result = fn(arg);
    cache.set(arg, result);
    return result;
  };
}

const slowSquare = (n) => {
  console.log('Calculating...');
  return n * n;
};

const fastSquare = memoize(slowSquare);

console.log(fastSquare(5)); // Calculating... 25
console.log(fastSquare(5)); // 25 (cached result, no calculation)
</code></pre>
        <p>See? Memoization is just caching. Simple.</p>
        <p>Or take <strong>dependency injection.</strong> Sounds fancy, but really it’s just passing things your code
            needs instead of hardcoding them. This makes your code easier to test and change later.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">class Logger {
  log(message) {
    console.log(`Log: ${message}`);
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor(logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
  }
  
  createUser(name) {
    this.logger.log(`Creating user: ${name}`);
    // Logic to create user
  }
}

const logger = new Logger();
const userService = new UserService(logger);
userService.createUser('Alice');
</code></pre>
        <p>No magic here, just passing in what you need.</p>
        <p>The funny part? Many of us have been doing these things long before learning their fancy names. But when the
            jargon hits, it can feel like we’re suddenly lost in translation.</p>
        <p>If you’re a non-native English speaker, this struggle is even bigger. Learning programming <em>and</em> the
            specialized language that comes with it is exhausting. It sometimes feels like you need a translator just to
            understand a tutorial.</p>
        <p>So here’s a little advice: don’t get hung up on the names. If you understand the concept, you’re already
            ahead of the game. The words are just labels to help us talk to each other, not tests of your skill.</p>
        <p>Next time you hear about <strong>early exit</strong>, <strong>memoization</strong>, or <strong>dependency
                injection</strong>, smile to yourself. Chances are, you’ve already been doing them without even knowing
            the names.</p>
        <p>And if you get confused, just remember: behind every complicated-sounding term is usually a simple idea
            waiting to be discovered.</p>
