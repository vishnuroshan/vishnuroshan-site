  <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
  <div class="meta">Posted on May 30, 2025</div>
  <p>Welcome! This blog is my personal journal for recording learnings, discoveries, and interesting things I encounter about JavaScript, TypeScript, and the broader world of web development. Here, you'll find notes, deep dives, and practical tips as I explore new features, patterns, and best practices. My goal is to document not just what I know, but what I’m learning—so I can look back, share with others, and keep growing as a developer.</p>
  <p>If you’re passionate about clean code, curious about how things work under the hood, or just want to follow along as I experiment and learn, you’re in the right place. Thanks for reading!</p>
